##Best practices

###HTML

- Always declare DOCTYPE and character encoding
- Never ever use inline CSS
- Link to your CSS files within the ```<head>``` tag in your page
- Add your script files to the bottom of the page, just before the closing ```<body>``` tag
- Make your HTML semantic
- Use lowercase markup
- Write consistently formatted code
- Validate your code

###CSS

- Avoid styling with only classes and id's, use the CSS3 selectors instead
- Use an external style sheet to style your HTML


###Javascript

- Don't use global variables/objects
- Use short clear (meaningful) names
- Constructor function start with capital
- Constants with all captials
- camelCase the rest
- Place external scripts at the bottom of the page
- Don't repeat yourself
